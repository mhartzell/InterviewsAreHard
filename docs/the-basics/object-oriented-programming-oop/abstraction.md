# Abstraction

Abstraction takes a concept or entity and elevates the most useful and relevant aspects while discarding the rest. Abstraction is critical to managing complexity, and the breaking down of a larger problem into smaller, more manageable components. Abstraction provides the most useful information to specific audiences, simplifying real-world concepts and allowing their relevant properties to be captured in the data modeling process.  Abstraction often reduces the complexity at the expense of additional overhead and slower performance.

"Good" applications introduce multiple levels of abstraction 

### Examples

* A programming language is an abstraction over hardware layers. A programmer uses language constructs rather than directly filling data in CPU registers. 
* An interface is an abstraction of an object. A public interface provides the accessors and mutators that are relevant to a given audience. 
* A car lot provides an example of abstraction. The car lot is filled with cars. The on-site mechanic cares about engine performance and outstanding mechanical problems. A salesman cares about available features and amenities, as well as the aesthetic presentation of the car. The lot manager cares about the state of a carâ€™s ownership. A customer may care about all of the prior details of a car, as well the color. Each car provides all these details, but not every audience cares about all the details that are available.
