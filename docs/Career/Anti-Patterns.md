Career Development by Coincidence is the idea that by developing certain skills, habits or techniques, the universe will magically reward you with forward progress and advancement in your career.  Rather, you should envision where you want to be in your career, and then work backwards to the activities that will accomplish that outcome.  Make sure the activities are measureable.
