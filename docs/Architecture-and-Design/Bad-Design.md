# Bad Design
In theory, there is not good or bad architecture / design, only architecture that is more or less able to achieve its intended purpose.  Good design is one that meets the quality attributes required by stakeholders, while bad design does not.  

# Rigidity
When a system is rigid, a change in one part of the system necessitates a change in another part of the system.

# Fragility
When a system is fragile, even small changes can cause other parts of the system to break unintentionally. 

# Immobility
When a system is immobile, parts of the system cannot be easily reused because of tight coupling and complex dependencies.
