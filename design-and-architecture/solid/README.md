# SOLID

SOLID is acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by Robert C. Martin as the five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design. The intention is that these principles, when applied together, will make it more likely that a programmer will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time. The principles of SOLID are guidelines that can be applied while working on software to remove code smells by providing a framework through which the programmer may refactor the software's source code until it is both legible and extensible.

The five principles are:

* The Single-Responsibility Principle
* The Open / Closed Principle
* The Liskov Substitution Principle
* The Segregated Interface Principle
* The Dependency Inversion Principle
