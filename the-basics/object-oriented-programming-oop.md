# Object-Oriented Programming \(OOP\)

Object-oriented programming \(OOP\) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes or properties; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. OOP uses objects to abstract and model a problem domain, making it easier to understand. A system is therefore represented by a collection of these objects that interact with each other.

OOP contrasts sharply with the philosophy of Procedural Programming, which uses procedures \(also known as routines, subroutines, or functions\) which simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.
