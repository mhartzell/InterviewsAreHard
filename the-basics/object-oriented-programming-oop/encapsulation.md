# Encapsulation

Encapsulation describes the hiding of both an object's data and behavior from external parties, by restricting access solely to an object’s accessors and mutators. Internal details therefore become irrelevant to external callers, and can be changed without external callers needing to know about those changes. Encapsulation also prevents external callers from setting the data of an object to an invalid or inconsistent state.

An accessor, also known as a getter, is a property or method that provides information about an object to the outside world.  A mutator, also known as a setter, is a public method that is used to modify the internal state of an object, while hiding the details of how that object’s data is changed.

Encapsulation leads to a cohesive object
