# Abstraction

Abstraction takes a concept or entity and elevates the most useful and relevant aspects while discarding the rest. Abstraction is critical to managing complexity, and the breaking down of a larger problem into smaller, more manageable components. Abstraction provides the most useful information to specific audiences, simplifying real-world concepts and allowing their relevant properties to be captured in the data modeling process.  Abstraction often reduces the complexity at the expense of additional overhead and slower performance.

"Good" applications introduce multiple levels of abstraction
