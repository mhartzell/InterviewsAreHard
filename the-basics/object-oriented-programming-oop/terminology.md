# Terminology



| Abstract Method | A signature with no implementation body, often used to specify that a subclass must provide an implementation of the method. |
| :--- | :--- |
| Abstract Type | A type that cannot be instantiated directly, and may provide no implementation, or an incomplete implementation. |
| Access Modifiers | Keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. |
| Base Class | A class from which another class inherits from. |
| Class | A data structure that defines an object, its data, behaviors, and members. |
| Class Interface | The defined public members of a class. |
| Collaboration | “Uses a” - Objects can collaborate with other objects. |
| Composition | “Has a” - Objects can be composed of other objects. |
| Concrete Class | A class having no abstract operations and can be instantiated. |
| Constructor | Code that is executed during the initial instantiation of a class. |
| Coupling | The degree of interdependence between modules, services and objects. |
| Deep Copy | A copy-by-value, where a new entity contains references to identical values stored in new memory allocations. |
| Default Constructor | A constructor with no arguments that assigns default initial values to all data members in a newly created instance of a class. |
| Destructor | A method which is automatically invoked when the object is destroyed. |
| Dynamic Binding | The method being called upon an object or the function being called with arguments is looked up by name at runtime. |
| Dynamic Dispatch | The process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation \(method or function\) to call at run time. |
| First-Class Citizen | An entity which supports all the operations generally available to other entities, which typically include being passed as an argument, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable. |
| Function | A sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a unit. |
| Inheritance | “Is a” - Objects can be subtyped. |
| Instantiation | The process of creating \(giving a value to\) instances from classes. |
| Interface | A defined, contractual, abstract set of properties and methods. |
| Iterator | An object that enables a programmer to traverse a container, particularly lists. |
| Member | The properties,methods and other attributes of a class. |
| Member Variable | A variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods. |
| Message Passing | The fundamental mechanism of program execution by which objects send each other messages. |
| Method | The computations and actions that can be performed by a class. |
| Method Signature | The name and parameters of a class function.  Does not include return type. |
| Name Binding | The association of entities \(data and/or code\) with identifiers. An identifier bound to an object is said to reference that object. |
| Orthogonality | The ability to use various language features in arbitrary combinations with consistent results. |
| Overloading | Methods that have identical names but different method parameters. |
| Overriding | The replacement implementation of a function provided by an inherited object |
| Pass-By-Reference | Method of passing an argument that permits the function to refer to the memoryholding the original copy of the argument. |
| Pass-By-Value | Method of passing an argument that evaluates the argument and stores this value in the corresponding formal argument, so the function has its own copy of the argument value. |
| Primitive Data Type | Either a data type provided by a programming language as a basic building block \(basic type\), or a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support. |
| Property | The data members defined by a class. |
| Recursion | A method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. |
| Reflection | The ability of a computer program to examine, introspect, and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime. |
| Scope | The part of a computer program where a name binding is valid, or where the name can be used to refer to the entity. |
| Shallow Copy | A copy-by-reference, where a new entity contains references to existing values in memory. |
| Static | Belongs to the class itself, not to an instance of the class. |
| Strongly Typed | A language that statically resolves types at compile-time, via the compiler. |
| Type | A classification identifying one of various types of data, that determines the possible values for that type, the operations that can be done on values of that type, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored. |
| Type Casting | Explicit type conversion which is explicitly defined within program code. |
| Type Coercion | Implicit type conversion via an automatic type conversion by the compiler. |
| Type Conversion | The changing an entity of one data type into another |
| Type Checking | The process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types that may occur either at compile-time \(a static check\) or at run-time. |
| Type Safety | The extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents the erroneous or undesirable program behavior caused by a discrepancy between differing data types for the program's constants, variables, and methods. |
| Type System | A collection of rules that assign a property called type to various constructs a computer program consists of, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules. The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically \(at compile time\), dynamically \(at run time\), or as a combination of static and dynamic checking. |
| Variable | A storage location paired with an associated symbolic name \(an identifier\), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. |
| Virtual Function | An inheritable and overridable function or method for which dynamic dispatch is facilitated. |
| Weakly Typed | A language that dynamically resolves types at run-time. |
| Weak Reference | A reference that does not protect the referenced object from collection by a garbage collector, unlike a strong reference. |
