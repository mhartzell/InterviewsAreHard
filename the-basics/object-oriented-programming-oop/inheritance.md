# Inheritance

Inheritance is the process of sharing common logic between similar but distinct objects. One object can inherit behavior, and sometimes data, from another object, without the need to duplicate that behavior. Additionally, that behavior can be overridden to provide a more specific implementation for the inheriting object.

Inheritance establishes an “is-a” relationship between objects.
