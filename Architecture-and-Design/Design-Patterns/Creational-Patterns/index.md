# Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling this object creation.

Creational design patterns are composed of two dominant ideas. One is encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses. Another is hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.
