# Architecture and Design
Software Architecture are the fundamental structures of a software system.  Each structure comprises software elemenets, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations.  Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices that are costly to change once implemented.

_"There is no such thing as an inherently good or bad architecture.  Architectures are either more or less fit for some purpose."_ - Software Architecture in Practice
